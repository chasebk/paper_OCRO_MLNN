```code 
- How to read my repository:

1. folders
+ SPRINGER: latex paper for springer journal 
+ IJCIS: latex paper for IJCIS (accepted)
+ ref: reference papers 
+ table and images: used in both SPRINGER and IJCIS latex source 
+ table_full: additional materials (not used)
```


# Publication
Due to the policy of the journal, I'm not allowed to publicize the paper after it was accepted. So I upload the final version of my paper before accepted.

If you guys interested in my paper or has any comment about it. Feel free to contact me via email: nguyenthieu2102@gmail.com
